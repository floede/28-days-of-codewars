## Description
A coding challenge for the seanwes community inspired by [30 Days to Better Writing](https://seanwes.com/30-days-to-better-writing/), [100Daysofcode](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code) and front end challenges in the community.
The idea is to show up every day, solve a small challenge with code and track your progress. 
By using codewars.com as the platform we can each get challenges according to our own skill level and language of choice. But more importantly it gives you the chance to compare your solution to everybody elses. That's invaluable.

## If you've decided to join:
1. Sign up on [Codewars](http://www.codewars.com/) and add "seanwes" as your clan.
2. Fork this repo and commit to the [Log](log.md) daily. [Example](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-kallaway-log).
3. **Code minimum 28 minutes every day for the next 28 days by solving one or more challenges**
4. Change the date in [Rules](rules.md) to the day you've started the challenge.
5. Delete the examples in the log, or comment them out, and start filling it with your own content.
6. If you feel like blogging, write about what you learned from comparing your own solution to other examples
7. Tell us how it goes in Tech room at [talk.seanwes.com](http://talk.seanwes.com)
